= Usage =

In order to embed a video, create a new post/page and use the following shortcode:

`[flowplayer src="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/test.mp4"]`

here, src is the actual source of your mp4 video file.

In addition to the source mp4 video file, you can also specify a webm video file. This step is optional since mp4 video is supported by almost all major browsers.

`[flowplayer src="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/test.mp4" webm="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/test.webm"]`

*Autoplay Video*

If you want a particular video to start playing when the page loads you can set the "autoplay" option to "true":

`[flowplayer src="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/test.mp4" autoplay="true"]`

*Player Size*

By default, the player takes up the full width of the content area. You can easily control the size by specifying a width for it:

`[flowplayer src="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/test.mp4" width="500"]`

The height will be automatically determined based on the ratio (please see the "Control Player Ratio section" for details).

*Player Ratio*

The player ratio is set to "0.417" by default. But you can override it by specifying a different ratio in the shortcode:

`[flowplayer src="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/test.mp4" ratio="0.345"]`

*Loop Video*

If you want a particular video to start playing again when it ends you can set the "loop" option to "true":

`[flowplayer src="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/test.mp4" loop="true"]`
